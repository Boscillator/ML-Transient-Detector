- This is a project to build a transient detector using a conventional architecture, but optimized via machine learning
- Perfer JAX over numpy
- JAX code used in the core model must be differentiable and jitable
- For complex functions, test your code by importing just the function you need and running it
- Use uv to manage the project
- Imports go at the top of the file, not inside functions
